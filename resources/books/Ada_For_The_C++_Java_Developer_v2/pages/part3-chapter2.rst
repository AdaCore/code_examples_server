Language-Defined Types
======================

The principal scalar types predefined by Ada are *Integer*, *Float*, *Boolean*, and *Character*. These correspond to **int**, **float**, **bool**/**boolean**, and **char**, respectively. The names for these types are not reserved words; they are regular identifiers.
